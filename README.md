# Exotic-Tea-Co.
Developed a full-stack, responsive e-commerce website for Exotic Tea Co. using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. Leveraged XAMPP for backend development. The project resulted in a complete and visually appealing website, ready for deployment, showcasing various teas and enabling seamless online transactions.
I have provided the full code for the website(all HTML CSS JS PHP files).
You only need to have the following installed:
~PHP
~XAMPP server( with Apache and SQL Working and connected in it).
